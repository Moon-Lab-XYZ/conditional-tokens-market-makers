   :alt: Build Status

Fork of https://github.com/gnosis/conditional-tokens-market-makers but uses a local version of ConstructedCloneFactory that is usually from @gnosis.pm/util-contracts. This contract is only in a specific version of that package and can cause problems when other versions are used in the same repo.

Automated Market Makers for the Prediction Markets 2.0 (Conditional Tokens) platform.
